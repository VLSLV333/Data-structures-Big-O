//              time complexity  in   arrays.               Since we talk about arrays in Java and C arrays are static, so we can not change their size later on. So if we male array to big it will reserve memory that will remain empty, if we reserve to little, it will run out of space.

//      Lookup for specific number (in case we know its index)  =  O(1)

//     Insert whole array  into new larger array  =   O(n).   Because we need to go thru each number in array (1 mil or whatever)

//      Delete  some parts of array   =  O(n).     We need to find the right number first (loop thru everything). Also if we talk about Java  using shift removes 1 item and moves all of them in that direction  =  O(n).
